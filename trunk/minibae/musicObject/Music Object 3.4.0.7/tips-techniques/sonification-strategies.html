Same
JavaScript required
Basic interactivity: 22K
Adv. Interactivity: 36K


Download RMF files with banner (short music files or voice)

Examples:	 Intel sound
		"Do You Yahoo? with instrumental lead-in
		Voice saying "Searching now" for Infoseek button. 

Custom RMF file downloaded
Adds a little more to file size. Calculation depends on length of sound and quality.

Can be as low as 1K (or less)       for an instrument sample or a       sound effect, bigger for a long instrumental or voice. 

Files often average 15K/seconds.

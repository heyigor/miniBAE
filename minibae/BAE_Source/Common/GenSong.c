**  6/5/98      Jim Nitchals RIP    1/15/62 - 6/5/98
**              I'm going to miss your irreverent humor. Your coding style and desire
**              to make things as fast as possible. Your collaboration behind this entire
**              codebase. Your absolute belief in creating the best possible relationships 
**              from honesty and integrity. Your ability to enjoy conversation. Your business 
**              savvy in understanding the big picture. Your gentleness. Your willingness 
**              to understand someone else's way of thinking. Your debates on the latest 
**              political issues. Your generosity. Your great mimicking of cartoon voices. 
**              Your friendship. - Steve Hales

**  5/16/99     Moved GM_BeginSong & GM_PrerollSong from GenSeq.c
**  6/15/99     Moved GM_EndSong from GenSeq.c. Split the control of GM_EndSong into

**              Added GM_EndSongButKeepActive
**  6/17/99     Removed access to global MusicGlobals from PV_EndSongWithControl. Changed

**              Added GM_Mixer parameter to GM_LoadSong
**  3/3/2000    Added GM_SetupSongRemaps. Moved GM_RemapInstrument from GenPatch.c
**              Modifed PV_CreateSongFromMidi & GM_CreateLiveSong & GM_LoadSongInstrument
**              to support the new function GM_SetupSongRemaps.

**  3/7/2000    Added GM_IsSongInstrumentRemapped
**  3/10/2000   Fixed memory leak in GM_FreeSong. Thanks Andrew. In the rare case of an instrument
**              failing to unload, the midi data pointer is lost.
**  3/14/2000   Fixed GM_RemapInstrument to actaully map the correct direction! Fixed
**              GM_LoadSongInstrument to map the correct direction!
**  4/3/2000    Changed GM_GetSongInstrumentReamp to GM_GetSongInstrumentRemap
**  4/19/2000   Changed GM_LoadSongInstrument to always force a recheck of the
**              alias link for the current patch bank.
**  4/25/2000   msd: added GM_GetProgramBank() to support MiniBAE API lego.
**  2000.05.16 AER  Completed modifications for new sample cache
**  2000.05.25 sh   Use GM_SetSongLoopFlag/GM_GetSongLoopFlag instead of touching 
**                  the structure GM_Song directly
**  6/19/2000   jsc: in GM_SetSongTickPosition, if song was paused, then don't resume song  
**  2000.07.14 AER  Modified access to XBankTokens for new system
**  8/27/2000   sh  Changed GM_SetSongTickPosition & GM_SetSongMicrosecondPosition to return 
**                  a error code correctly.
**  12/7/2000   sh  Changed GM_GetSongTickLength & GM_GetSongMicrosecondLength to return
**                  an overflow error.
**  1/25/2001   sh  Added GM_IsSongPrerolled.
**  2/14/2001   se  Found pause/resume bug in GM_SetSongTickPosition/GM_SetSongMicrosecondPosition
**  2/16/2001   se  Modified GM_SetSongMicrosecondPosition to kill current notes rather than 
**                  allow them to release.
**  3/8/2001    se  Modified GM_GetSongTickLength to stop calculation
**                  when the song being operated on has a duration of over one hour.
**  3/29/2001   sh  Removed extra line in GM_GetSongTickLength that copied over the
**                  temporary position of the song which resulted in a bogus position
**                  being returned for the song in question.
**  7/24/2001       Added PV_FindEmptySongSlot, and now only place preloaded song
**                  into mixer when GM_BeginSong is called.
